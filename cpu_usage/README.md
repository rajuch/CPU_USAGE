#CPU USAGE

A pythonic web application that displays CPU usage of processes on a machine.

The application samples the CPU usage of all processes running on the server (similar to the 'top' command on the UNIX like systems) at the frequency of 1 second. It also maintains running averages of the CPU usage for each process over the past 60 seconds. The information collected about the CPU usage is then displayed as a GET XHR.

The webapp doesn't use any web frameworks like Django. Neither does the implementation use external libraries for client side implementation. Back-end is pure python. Front-end is Javascript and HTML5.
